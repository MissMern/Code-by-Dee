          <div class="intro-text">
            <p>Hey there! I'm Dee — a full-time wanderer, part-time storyteller, and someone who genuinely believes that every place has a story worth telling.</p>
            <p>I started this blog as a way to remember the sunsets I chased, the mountains I got lost in, and the strangers who became friends. Some days are chaotic, some magical — but all of them are mine, and now, a little bit yours too.</p>
            <p>If you’re looking for perfectly posed Instagram moments, you might be a little disappointed. But if you love messy hair, dusty boots, missed flights, and the kind of moments that make your heart race — welcome. You’re in the right place.</p>
